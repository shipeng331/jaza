<h1>The Jaza Animator</h1>

Jaza is an `Animator' for the Z formal specification language.
<p>
It is intended to help you validate specifications via:
<ul>
  <li>evaluating Z expressions;
  <li>testing Z schemas against example data values;
  <li>executing Z specifications (but not all specifications
      are executable). 
</ul>

Jaza is free, open-source software, distributed under the GPL (GNU Public
License).  It was developed here at the University of Waikato, mostly
by me (Mark Utting).  Development started mid-1999 and the current
version animates almost all of Spivey Z (2nd edition), except generics,
bags and axiomatic definitions.
Here is the <a href="doc/userman.pdf">Jaza User Manual and
Tutorial</a> in PDF format (included in the distributions also).

<p>
The following releases of Jaza (version 1.1) are available:
<ul>
  <li><a href="dist/jaza_1_1_win.zip">Binary Release 1.1 for Windows XP</a>.
  <li><a href="dist/jaza_1_1_linux.tgz">Binary Release 1.1 for Linux</a>.
      This was compiled under Gentoo Linux, using GHC 6.2 with static
      libraries, so should also work on many other versions of Linux.
  <li><a href="dist/jaza_1_1_source.tgz">Source Release 1.1</a>.  This
      requires you to install Haskell first, either <a href="http://www.haskell.org/hugs">Hugs98</a>
      or GHC.
</ul>
<p>
A summary of the main recent changes:
<ul>
  <li>Jun 2005 (release 1.1): Improved evaluation of some function calls -- arguments are
      now evaluated into canonical form before the function application.
      This version has one known bug, when multiple exists at the same
      level contain the same bound variable name.  See the
      <a href="README.txt">README</a> file for details.
  <li>Mar 2005 (release 1.0):
      The 'why' command now gives better
      explanation about where and why evaluation was too difficult.
      Numerous optimisation improvements so that more expressions
      and schemas can be evaluated.  In particular, nested exists within
      schemas and set comprehensions are now unfolded then optimised.
  <li>28 Jun 2002: Alpha release of Z to BZP translators for Linux and
      Windows.
  <li>15 Apr 2002 0.90: Binary version now has command line editing.
      (Source version provides command line editing if Hugs does,
      but always handles backspaces).  Extensive internal rewrite
      to use the visitor design pattern.  Schemas that contain false
      are now optimized more agressively.
  <li>7 Dec 2000 0.86: several errors fixed, so that nested
      \forall, \mu terms etc. are now more agressively optimized.
  <li>1 Nov 2000 0.84: vastly improved error messages.
      Explicit bindings (\lblot..\rblot) are now supported.
</ul>

<p>
The distributions include a user manual.  Here is a
<a href="doc/jaza.ps.gz">paper</a>
(also in <a href="doc/jaza.pdf">PDF</a>)
about the philosophy and implementation of Jaza, including
a small comparison with several other Z animators.
This paper was presented at the FM-TOOLS 2000 conference in Germany,
July 2000 (in TR 2000-07, Information Faculty, University of Ulm).
